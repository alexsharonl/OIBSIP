This is an oasis infobyte java programmer internship repository where I had done two tasks in java programming language

Tasks are :

1. Number guessing game
2. ATM Interface

NUMBER GUESSING GAME:-

This is a funny and easy "Guess the Number" game. It is a short java project allows user to guess the number generated by the computer and involves the following:

The system generates a random number from range of 1-100.

The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.

The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.

The game continues under the user guessing the number.

At last the total attempts will be displayed and can start a new game from that window.

So, this is about number guessing game.

-ATM Interface:-

This is a complex project consists of five different classes and it is a console-based application. When the system starts the user asked to login using that user Id and user pin. And these 2 processes the user will be able to perform follwing functionalities:

Transaction History

1. Withdraw

2. Deposit

3. Fund Transfer

4. Balance Enquiry

5. Quit

So, this is a basic idea about the ATM interface project.
